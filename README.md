## Overview

This project works as a developer-focused Linktree, bringing together important links, social media profiles, and relevant information all in one place.

### My Process

This project was built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
One of the main challenges was integrating the Prismic CMS for content management.
I also developed the functionality that allows users to switch between light and dark themes in the application.
